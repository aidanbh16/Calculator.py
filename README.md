# Calculator.py
Default python calculator.exe file and source code

Thank you for downloading my "Calculator.py" This is my first python project
and I built this to start a portfolio that I have been putting off making
for a while. This is my statement that I am now commited to learning and becoming
a software engineer. Python was a fairly easy language to work with and I didn't want
to make a basic calculator in the terminal like most people. I decided to mess around 
with the tkinter, built-in plug-in to see if I could make a usable GUI and executable
file. This project has taught me the ability of pips and downloading online sources
through CMD. It has been a great learning experience and I hope to have many more
projects on the way.
